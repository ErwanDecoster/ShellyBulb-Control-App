# ShellyBulb-Control-App
The ShellyBulb Control App is a web application that allows users to control their Shelly smart bulbs remotely. The app provides a user-friendly interface to turn the bulbs on or off with a single click, as well as adjust the color and brightness settings. 

The application is built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js, with MySQL used as the database for storing bulb information. The communication with the Shelly bulbs is facilitated through a custom Shelly API, which handles the interactions with the bulbs using the Shelly REST API.
